Historical

in 2012-05 HolisticWare team begun to merge 
	MonoTouch.Dialog 
and 
	Monodroid.Dialog 
into one solution and for MonoTouch there was missing System.Json namespace.

So downloaded System.Json made by JeffreyZhao from GitHub:
	https://github.com/JeffreyZhao/System.Json
This was extract from mono to allow System.Json to run under framework 3.5
client profile.

With smaller fixes (mainly for Extension Methods) desktop dll can be used for
framework 2.0 and 3.0.

System.Json
